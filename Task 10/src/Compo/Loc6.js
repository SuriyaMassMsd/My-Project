              Rameshwaram is located on a beautiful island in the South Indian
              state of Tamil Nadu. It is separated by a small Pamban channel
              from Sri Lanka. According to Hindu mythology, this is the place
              where Lord Rama created a bridge across the sea to Sri Lanka.

              Renowned for its magnificent prakaras with massive sculptured
              pillars on either side, The Ramanathaswamy Temple houses the
              longest corridor in the world. Agniteertham is famous for its
              sacred waters and Pilgrims perform poojas in honour of their
              ancestors at this seashore. The five-faced Hanuman Temple holds
              the floating stone which was used to build the bridge between
              India and Sri Lanka. Rameshwaram has the first sea bridge
              connecting the town of Mandapam with Pamban Island, and
              Rameswaram.
